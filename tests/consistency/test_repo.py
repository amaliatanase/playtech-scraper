"""Consistency tests: root files, ai/ docs, workflow naming, changelog, gitignore.

Adapted from the Python reference template's tests/consistency/test_repo.py,
genericised for Brewtality-3-16 (no company-specific assertions). Two checks
are intentionally soft-skipped, not hard-required, until the rest of the
compliance-audit work lands in this same repo: the full ai/*.md doc set and
the root community-health files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md/CONTRIBUTING.md/
SECURITY.md). Once those files exist the skip condition stops firing and the
assertion runs for real -- no one needs to remember to re-enable anything.
